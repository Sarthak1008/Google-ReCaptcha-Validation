In this spring boot project we implement the Google ReCaptcha validation for the new employee registration to our application. Basically, ReCaptcha validation is done to prevent the robot from sending the data through POST Request.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have a valid Google ReCaptcha site key and secret key.
- JDK 8 or higher installed on your machine.
- Apache Maven installed.
